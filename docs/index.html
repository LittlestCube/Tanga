            In case you want some background on Tanga: <br><br> Around October or November of 2016, I had to write an essay on The Song of Roland, a book which contains many plots and setpieces, but only one is of importance: The Battle Between Roland
            and the Saracens. In this battle, Roland is about to lose horribly, and his men are on the verge of extinction. In the heat of battle, Roland’s good friend and battle buddy, Olivier, addresses the fact that they are about to die horribly,
            and that they should call their men back to regroup. Roland, however, refuses to do this, and that they’ll make it. If you have any sort of intelligence, you can guess that they did not, in fact, “make it.” The essay question was “was Roland
            wrong in rejecting Olivier’s plea?” The essay received an A-, which was a huge step up from the last essay I wrote, which received a B. While I was writing this essay, the way I was supposed to use structure finally clicked. Everything seemed
            to flow one sentence right after the other. Once I realized what I had been doing wrong, I had the idea for this. I named it the EssayWriter. <br><br> The next time we had to write an essay, we wrote it on Dante’s Inferno. This was the first
            essay written with the EssayWriter, and it received an A. I knew I was on the right track.<br><br> Later, I decided to coin a new name for the EssayWriter itself. I chose the name Tanga, and here we are.
            <br><br> Over time, I have added more and more to the algorithm and the functionality of the Writer itself, and now those changes can be found here.<br><br> I hope it helps you write your essays.
