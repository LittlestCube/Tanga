# Tanga Releases

Welcome back. I suppose you're wondering what happened to the old repo. It can be found [here](https://github.com/LittlestCube/TheEssayWriter), but this is now the repo that will house all new releases.

The EssayWriter is, as of now, being renamed to Tanga.

Like it? It's pretty dope (also it's pronounced TAN-ja), but why rename it, you ask?

Search on GitHub for EssayWriter, then you'll see why. (seriously, there are a LOT of EssayWriters)

In case you want some background on Tanga:

Around October or November of 2016, I had to write an essay on The Song of Roland, a book which
contains many plots and setpieces, but only one is of importance: The Battle Between Roland and
the Saracens. In this battle, Roland is about to lose horribly, and his men are on the verge of
extinction. In the heat of battle, Roland’s good friend and battle buddy, Olivier, addresses the
fact that they are about to die horribly, and that they should call their men back to regroup. 
Roland, however, refuses to do this, and that they’ll make it. If you have any sort of 
intelligence, you can guess that they did not, in fact, “make it.” The essay question was “was
Roland wrong in rejecting Olivier’s plea?” The essay received an A-, which was a huge step up 
from the last essay I wrote, which received a B. While I was writing this essay, the way I was
supposed to use structure finally clicked. Everything seemed to flow one sentence right after 
the other. Once I realized what I had been doing wrong, I had the idea for this. I named it 
the EssayWriter.

The next time we had to write an essay, we wrote it on Dante’s Inferno. This was the first
essay written with the EssayWriter, and it received an A. I knew I was on the right track.

Later, I decided to coin a new name for the EssayWriter itself. I chose the name Tanga, and here
we are.

Over time, I have added more and more to the algorithm and the funcitonality of the Writer 
itself, and now those changes can be found here.

I hope it helps you write your essays.
